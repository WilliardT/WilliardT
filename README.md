Hi 👋 I'm Gleb

Fullstack (React, Go, TypeScript).
I design and build scalable backend services, API-first architectures, and Server-Driven UI (SDUI) solutions for real business products.

My core strength is translating complex business requirements into clean, maintainable system architectures and developer-friendly APIs. A strong frontend background helps me design backend systems from the consumer’s perspective — making integrations predictable, stable, and scalable.
